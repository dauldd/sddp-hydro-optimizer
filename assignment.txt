                      RIVERVAULT CRISIS
========================================================================

Deep beneath the mossy hills, the Gnomish City of Rivervault 
hums with activity. For centuries, the gnomes have powered their 
bustling factories and a city with a mix of three underground 
hydropower plants and a geothermal station, never once needing 
to buy electricity from outsiders.

But three days ago, disaster struck: 
a massive earthquake shook the underground tunnels, collapsing 
caverns and rupturing the geothermal pipes. The geothermal station
went offline instantly. Repairs are underway, but it will take a 
week before the geothermal station can produce power again.

To keep the city running, the gnomes pushed their hydro plants 
harder than ever - too hard. Yesterday, the first two plants were 
running so fast that the riverbanks near the third plant 
overflowed, causing costly damage and endangering a nearby village. 

Today, the gnomes finally connected to the neighboring city’s 
power grid. They can buy electricity if needed, 
but **cannot sell any back**.
There’s a catch: market prices have skyrocketed after similar 
earthquakes in the region. Buying too much power may bankrupt 
the city, but cutting supply isn’t an option—the factory and 
a city must keep its most critical systems online.

At an emergency council meeting, a gnome suggests:

  "We can optimize hydropower production! I even know two… uh… 
   forecasting guilds in the next city who can provide inflow 
   and price predictions for the next week. We don’t know which 
   one is better, so let’s trust them equally for now."

There’s another problem: when water spills over the riverbanks, 
it damages the environment, and the longer it stays high, 
the more expensive the repairs. The council agrees:

  "We need a plan that balances energy demand, costs, and flood
   risk."

And that’s where you come in. The gnomes need software to 
optimize hydropower production for the coming week. 
Can you help them?

  >> Your mission: Optimize hydropower production for 7 days.

🗺️ RIVER SYSTEM TOPOLOGY

[Lake 1][      ↓] 
        [Plant 1]→[Lake 2][      ↓]
                          [Plant 2]→[Lake 3][      ↓]
                                            [Plant 3]→

Each lake has:
  - Minimum volume: below this, the next plant can't operate
  - Maximum volume: above this, damage occurs
  - Critical volume: above this, the village floods (GAME OVER)

Water from Lake 1 used by Power Plant 1 flows directly into Lake 2.
Water from Lake 2 used by Power Plant 2 flows directly into Lake 3.

Whenever water flows through a power plant, it always gets turned 
into energy - none of it is wasted. The generators are colossal 
marvels of gnomish engineering, capable of handling any torrent 
the river dares to throw at them. 

The produced energy must always match the demand, ensuring perfect 
balance between generation and consumption.

🎯 OBJECTIVE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The council needs you to design a mathematical model that determines 
how to operate the plants in an optimal way, taking into account all 
uncertainties.

To verify that your model produces plausible results, you were instructed 
to use the following test scenario:

🕰️ Price (in ₲) and inflows (in water units per day):

| Day       | Price ₲ | Inflow Lake 1 | Inflow Lake 2 | Inflow Lake 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Monday    |  950.0  |     31.0      |     21.0      |     11.0      |
| Tuesday   |  850.0  |     30.0      |     29.0      |     10.0      |
| Wednesday |  120.0  |     37.0      |     13.0      |      9.0      |
| Thursday  |    5.0  |     13.0      |      3.0      |      3.0      |
| Friday    |    2.0  |     39.0      |     12.0      |     21.0      |
| Saturday  |  250.5  |     24.0      |     18.0      |     21.0      |
| Sunday    |  741.0  |     27.0      |     25.0      |     30.0      |

The council wants to know:

What is the total cost of meeting the energy demand in this scenario 
using the optimization model?

========================================================================

   ...There are whispers among the elders that, centuries ago, when 
these hydropower plants were first built, the gnomes possessed a powerful 
optimization method - one that has since faded into legend. 
Curious, you scour the dusty shelves of the local library. After 
countless hours wandering the shadowed archives, you finally uncover 
a tattered manuscript, its pages brittle and ink faded by centuries. 
Most of its secrets have crumbled into dust - yet three words remain, 
etched like runes of forgotten power: “Julia lang” and “SDDP”.

What could they mean? 

Could this be the key to reviving the forgotten art of river 
optimization?
