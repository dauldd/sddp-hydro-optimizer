# SDDP Project

This project implements a Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming solution for a cascaded hydroelectric reservoir optimization problem.

## Structure

The notebook follows this order:

1. **Training**: SDDP algorithm training (please note that the training logs extend to 1000 iteration - sorry)
2. **Test**: Validation scenario execution
3. **Visualization**: Generation of analysis plots
4. **Explanations**: Detailed discussion of results and strategy can be found at the end

## Figures

All visualization figures can be found in the `figures/` folder.
